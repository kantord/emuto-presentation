# What is emuto?

---

## What is emuto?

emuto is a lightweight JSON processor

--

it is inspired by jq and it almost ports it

--

it is basically sed & awk for JSON


---

## Why are you building this?

--

jq is awesome, but it's written in C

--

compiled with emscripten it weighs several megabytes

--

I have a project where I need to take queries as input on the frontend and quickly evaluate them in the browser

<img src="just_dashboard.png" alt="" style="height: 10em; margin: auto; display: block;">

--

It'd be also nice to support some features based on new ES syntaxes

--

__So I decided to build a new compiler that is small enough to use in the browser__

---

## What is it all about?

In emuto you build transformations by combining filters.

Functions calls, literals, expressions and operations are filters, for example:

### Literals

```clike
["Hello", "World"]
```

### Function calls

```clike
map $ => $.foo
```

---

### Operations

```clike
.user.name
```

```clike
$[3, 4]
```

---

## Combining filters

To combine two filters you can use the pipe syntax:

```clike
["Hello", "World"] | join " "
```

Result:
```clike
  "Hello World"
```

---

Having the following JSON file as input:

```json
[
  {"user": {"name": "John", "age": 35}},
  {"user": {"name": "Mary", "age": 28}}
]
```

I want to generate this output:

```clike
"Hello John, Hello Mary"
```

--

Right off the bat, I only care about the user names, so I can simplify my data using this query:

```javascript
map $ => .user.name
```

--

```json
["John", "Mary"]
```

--

Now I want to greet each person individually, so I do this:

--

```javascript
map $ => .user.name | map $ => ["Hello", $]
```

--

I can actually do that in a single map:

```javascript
map $ => ["Hello", .user.name]
```

---

So now I have this:

```json
[["Hello", "John"], ["Hello", "Mary"]]
```

--

Still not exactly what I want so I join the inner arrays with a space:


```javascript
map $ => (["Hello", .user.name] | join " ")
```

```json
[["Hello John"], ["Hello Mary"]]
```
--

And I join the resulting array with a comma:


```javascript
map $ => (["Hello", .user.name] | join " ") | join ","
```


```json
"Hello John, Hello Mary"
```

--

Or I could just attach their greeting to the existing object:

```javascript
map $ => {
  "user": {
    ...$.user,
    "greeting": (["Hello", $.user.name] | join " ")
  }
}
```
