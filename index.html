# What is emuto?

---

## What is emuto?

emuto is a lightweight JSON processor

--

it is inspired by jq and it almost ports it

--

it is basically sed & awk for JSON


---

## Why are you building this?

--

jq is awesome, but it's written in C

--

compiled with emscripten it weighs several megabytes

--

I have a project where I need to take queries as input on the frontend and quickly evaluate them in the browser

--

It'd be also nice to support some features based on new ES syntaxes

--

__So I decided to build a new compiler that is small enough to use in the browser__
